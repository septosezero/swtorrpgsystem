-- any values you don't need in createJobSkills or createTalent you should comment out or delete,
-- leaving them as 'health = '0'' or 'health = nil' makes your file longer and could use up extra ram needlessly

-- also, don't, forgot, the, dashes, after, each, variable, or, table.
-- You will, because I forgot them all the time!
-- Also check the console to see if you made typos or illegal values!
-- DarkRPG prints out invalid talent values and tells you how to fix them in the console!

-- adds these values to the player at Level 1 automatically.
